                    Honestly I am not sure if I can say I am self taught but I
                    didn't had much people around me who were ready to help and
                    guide me. In college, I watched a few courses which were
                    available on LAN. I tried helping a few of my college mates
                    with their projects. Few college fest websites. Learning,
                    things from google, youtube, and stack flow at every step.

                    It was really hard for me to get my first job because
                    everyone needs a person with some professional experience.
                    So, after so many rejections I got my first job as a web
                    developer. For 1 years Iâ€™m working as a web developer in a
                    Company wellcreator. I have developed many websites, Mobile
                    apps and apart from that, I have been part of web design
                    projects, office work, and as a freelancer.
